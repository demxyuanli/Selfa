To enable Python extensions in the built application:
1. Download the "Windows x86-64 embeddable zip file" from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into this directory.
3. Ensure 'python.exe' is present in this folder.
4. (Optional) Install required packages (like pandas, numpy) into this folder or ensure the script sets up paths correctly.
